PBL provide trade flows for EU regions in 2013 disaggreagted by sectors of activity. 

This dataset only considers the sector of origin and not the sector of destination: It is not the full Input-Output matrix but an aggregated version.

Trade happens within and between sectors, but in the paper we only analyze the sector of origin (exporter) and not the destination sector of the importer.
